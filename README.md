# k8s-shards

Useful roles, snippets, and YAMLs for kube.

Secrets and playbooks are not provided, these are fragments pulled from the various clusters I maintain. While mildly
organized, this is as much for my reference as anything.

## Variables

Two variables must be provided: `secrets` as the root secret and `shards` as the root for everything else.
